'''
Imagine that you're a teacher who's just graded the final exam in a class. You have a list of student 
scores on the final exam in a particular order (not necessarily sorted), and you want to reward your 
students. You decide to do so fairly by giving them arbitrary rewards following two rules: first, all 
students must receive at least one reward; second, any given student must receive strictly more 
rewards than an adjacent student (a student immediately to the left or to the right) with a lower 
score and must receive strictly fewer rewards than an adjacent student with a higher score. 
Assume that all students have different scores; in other words, the scores are all unique. 
Write a function that takes in a list of scores and returns the minimum number of rewards that you 
must give out to students, all the while satisfying the two rules.
